## Chapter 3 - Your first assembly program

- [exit.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%203/exit.s) - a first assembly program showing the functionality of the exit() syscall
- [maximum.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%203/maximum.s) - finding the largest number in a data index
- [minimum.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%203/minimum.s) - finding the smallest number in a data index

## Chapter 4 - Functions

- [power.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%204/power.s) - illustrating how functions work by solving 2^3 + 5^2
- [factorial.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%204/factorial.s) - solving a factorial by creating a function
- [square.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%204/square.s) - solving a square x^2 = ? by creating a function

## Chapter 5 - Buffers & File Descriptors

- [toupper.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%205/toupper.s) - using buffers and file descriptors to change all lowercase letters of a file to all uppercase letters

## Chapter 6 - Reading and Writing Simple Records:

- [linux.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/linux.s) - common Linux definitions use .equ including syscalls, file descriptors, status codes, interrupts
- [record-def.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/record-def.s) - record offsets
- [add-year.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/add-year.s) - add a year to each record
- [count-chars.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/count-chars.s) - function to count the number of characters in a record
- [read-record.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/read-record.s) - function to read a record
- [read-records.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/read-records.s) - final program to read all the records
- [write-newline.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/write-newline.s) - function to write a newline to STDOUT
- [write-record.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/write-record.s) - function to write in a record
- [write-records.s](https://github.com/foomur/programming-ground-up/blob/master/chapter%206/write-records.s) - final program to write all the records
